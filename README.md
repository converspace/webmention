# Webmention 0.1

Webmention is a simple way to automatically notify any URL when you link to it on your site. From the receivers perspective, it's a way to request notification when other sites link to it.

Itâ€™s a modern alternative to [Pingback](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback) and other forms of [Linkback](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkback).

## Introduction

Here's a typical webmention flow:

1. Alice posts some interesting content on her site (which is setup to receive webmentions).
2. Bob sees this content and comments about it on his site, linking back to Alice's original post.
3. Using webmention, Bob's publishing software automatically notifies Alice's server that her post has been linked to along with the URL to Bob's post.
4. Alice's publishing software verifies that Bob's post actually contains a link to her post and then includes this information on her site.
